# SCG
Welcome to SCG. This is a card game I learned about from my Sister-in-Law's Family. They affectionatly refered to it as the Stupid Card Game. For reasons, I changed it to SCG. 

The Basic rules are this:
Set-up:
Each player gets 15 cards 
5 go faced down on the table in front of you
5 go face up on top of the face downs
5 go into your hand.

The remaining deck becomes the draw pile.

Play:
The active player draws in turn from the draw pile (until it is depleted) 
The player than chooses a card to discard. This card must be equal to or lower than the card on the discard (Ace being high). If the player can't play, the discard pile goes into their hand.

There are 2 sets of wild cards:
2's : twos resets the pile such that the next player can play whatever they want on the discard pile. The cards in the discard pile remain.

10's : Tens eliminate the discard pile from the game. The next player may play what they want.

4 of a kind: if 4 of a kind happens, the pile is discarded, like with a 10.

The goal of the game is to get rid of all cards in the players hand, and on the table. Order of the cards which a player must get rid of is Hand, Ups, Downs. If a player can't play while on their up's or downs, the discard goes into their hand and the player must get rid of those cards before resuming ridding of the ups or downs.
The Downs are chosen completly at random.

The Game ends once any player has no cards in their hand.
